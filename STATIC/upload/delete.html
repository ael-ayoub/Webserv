    <h1>Understanding HTTP DELETE</h1>
    <p>
        The HTTP DELETE method is used to request that the server remove a resource identified by a URL.
        Unlike GET or POST, DELETE is intended to remove data on the server. 
        Browsers don’t automatically send DELETE requests when you enter a URL; it must be sent by a client 
        script or tool that supports it, such as JavaScript, curl, or an API client.
    </p>

    <h2>Delete a File</h2>
    <!-- Input for the file path to delete -->
    <input type="text" id="filePath" placeholder="Enter file path to delete">
    <button onclick="deleteFile()">Delete</button>

    <p id="status"></p>

    <script>
        function deleteFile() {
            const path = document.getElementById('filePath').value;
            if (!path) {
                alert("Please enter a file path.");
                return;
            }

            fetch(path, { method: 'DELETE' })
                .then(response => {
                    if (response.ok) {
                        document.getElementById('status').textContent = "File deleted successfully.";
                    } else {
                        document.getElementById('status').textContent = "Error deleting file: " + response.status;
                    }
                })
                .catch(err => {
                    document.getElementById('status').textContent = "Request failed: " + err;
                });
        }
